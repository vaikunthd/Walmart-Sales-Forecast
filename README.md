![Walmart Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Walmart_logo.svg/320px-Walmart_logo.svg.png)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast Walmart's weekly sales using historical data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as store details, department information, and external influences like holidays, I strive to predict future sales accurately.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze historical Walmart sales data
- Identify key factors influencing sales
- Develop and compare multiple forecasting models
- Provide accurate weekly sales predictions

## 🗃️ Dataset

The project utilizes the following datasets:
- `stores.csv`: Store information
- `features.csv`: Additional features like temperature, fuel price, etc.
- `train.csv`: Historical sales data

Key features include:
- Store and department identifiers
- Date
- Weekly sales
- Is_holiday flag
- Temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Merging datasets
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting year, month, week)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing sales trends
   - Analyzing correlations between features
   - Identifying seasonal patterns

3. **Model Implementation**
   We implement and compare the following models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared (R2) score

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install required dependencies:
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Walmart_Sales_Forecast.ipynb`

## 📈 Results

My models show promising results in predicting Walmart's weekly sales. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more external data sources (e.g., economic indicators)
- Experiment with time series models (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Develop a web dashboard for interactive sales forecasting
